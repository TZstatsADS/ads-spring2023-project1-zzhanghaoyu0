### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Emotions carried in the History of Philosophy.
+ This project is conducted by [Haoyu Zhang]

+ Project summary: This project utilized the philosophy dataset from Philosophy Data Project(http://philosophydata.com/index.html) to analyze the emotions carried within the text of published philophical works. Since it is well-assumed that philosophical works carry relatively balanced emotions, this data story will be using the philosophy dataset to discover if any particular school's work carries significantly unbalanced positive or negative emotions. And if they are, what topics were those schools focused on. Moreover, this data story will try to reveal if the emotions for different philosophy schools vary over time.
